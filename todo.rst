Before public release
---

  * Ask MESA devs if it is ok to use their GEN-xml files (they seem to have no
    license assigned)

  * squash commits of legacy compute runtime code

  * make sure distributing (modified) MESA source files does not violate license
    terms

  * change project name in files (grep -rI)

  * add missing copyright statements where required
